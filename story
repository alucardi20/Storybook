Once upon a time, in a small town in Atlantis lived a young boy named Conan.
Conan was a sickly child and had to be taken to the village healer quite often
Many said Conan would die young
But Conan's drive was intense
Conan survived his childhood
Conan grew up to be a strapping young lad
He was full of vigour
Conan is now a teenager and has the usual teenage issues.
Conan is angry all the time and listens to metal
